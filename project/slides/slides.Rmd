## Project Description {#projectdescription .emphasized}
- Analyzing basketball players data from the NBA League in the 2015-2016 season


 Our Aim:  In the 2015-2016 season, how do the skills of a player relate to his salary?



## Source of Data
- Basketball Reference
- Roster, Total, and Salaries tables
![Source of Data](basketball.png =200x200)

## Methodology - Data Acquisition
- Two phases of webscraping
1. Get list of team abbreviations
2. Get the roster, salary, and totals tables via their IDs


## Methodology - Data Cleaning
- First we cleaned the data, then we merged the tables

\end{document}

## EDA
- Split data into qualitative and quantitative
- Qualitative - used dplyr and frequency to analyze
- Quantitative - used summary() to get a summary of statistics

## Data Analysis - EFF
- EFF = (total points + total rebounds + assists + steals + blocks - missed
field goals - missed free throws - turnovers) / (games played)
- $$\text{EFF} = \frac{|w_{1}|x_{1}}{\sigma_{1}} + ... + \frac{|w_{8}|x_{8}}{\sigma_{8}}$$
 where $x_{i} = \frac{\text{ basic individual statistics}}{Game Played (GP)}$

## Data Analysis - Salary Aggregates
- Aggregated salary data by team

## Shiny Apps:
- Check out our nifty apps:
1. Team Salaries app - https://stat133.shinyapps.io/team-salaries/
2. Statistic Salaries app - https://stat133.shinyapps.io/stat-salaries/

## Results
- EFF and salary are positively correlated (r = 0.474)
- Experience showed relatively weak correlation with EFF (r = 0.209)
- EFF is weakly correlated with points while strongly correlated with 
steals (r = 0.605) and defensive rebounds (r = 0.698, r = 0.706)

## Conclusions
- While there is a positive correlation between EFF and
salary, it is only moderate
- Our results can help managers better decide salaries for recruits
- We hypothesize that, in general, the salary is highly correlated 
with the number of wins that players bring in to the team
